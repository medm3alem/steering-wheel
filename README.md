# SolidWorks Steering Wheel Design for Ecocar Club

This project is part of the Ecocar Club at the National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT), with the goal of participating in and winning the Shell Eco-marathon. The objective of the club is to design and develop innovative and energy-efficient solutions for sustainable mobility. This particular project focuses on the design of a steering wheel, created using SolidWorks, consisting of four main parts:

- **Support**: This component connects the steering wheel to the steering shaft, providing a stable and secure link.
- **Rear and Front Pieces**: These two pieces enclose a metal part for added rigidity. They also serve as mounting structures for the LCD screen and buttons, ensuring a smooth touch surface for a comfortable and ergonomic driving experience.
- **Metal Piece**: The metal part enhances the structural strength of the steering wheel and includes ventilation holes to cool the electrical components of the screen and buttons.
- **Electronic Card Space**: A dedicated area within the front piece is designed to house the electronic card that manages the buttons and LCD screen.

This design aligns with the principles of the Shell Eco-marathon by prioritizing both efficiency and comfort, aiming to contribute to a competitive edge in the race while meeting the vehicle's design standards for sustainability and energy optimization.
